# NVIM CONFIG FILE 


This is my nvim config file, I want to thank [@stbuccia](https://github.com/stbuccia) and [@AnouarElKihal](https://github.com/AnouarElKihal) for their amazing setup from which I have taken inspiration.

A video of [@Neuralnine](https://github.com/NeuralNine) was the initial approach I took to nvim.
