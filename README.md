# nvim-config-file
*NEOVIM SETUP*

This is the config file for my nvim setup. I want to thank @stbuccia and @AnouarElKihal for their amazing setup from which I have taken some code.
I reccomend to watch the @NeuralNine's video about his setup because I have taken lots of instructions from it. I also suggest his video as a tutorial for beginners.
